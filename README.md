# EV-wireless_charging-optimization
 
This repository contains the Wireless Charging Utility Maximization (WCUM) framework, which maximizes the utility of Wireless Charging Units (WCUs) for EV charging through the optimal WCU deployment at signalized intersections. It also minimizes the control delay at all signalized intersections of the network. The framework consists of a two-step optimization formulation, a dynamic traffic assignment model to calculate the user equilibrium, a traffic micro-simulator to formulate the objective functions and a global Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming optimization solver. An optimization problem is formulated for each intersection, and another for the entire network. The performance of the WCUM framework is tested for twelve global MINLP solvers and 2 case studies.
